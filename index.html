					About The Stew<br><br><hr>
					
					<p>
						Hey there, I'm Josh, a Programmer and Designer from California. 
						I've been feeling the rush of making games since I was 16,
						and am currently an Indie developer. 
						I recently graduated from CSU Channel Islands, 
						studying Computer Science with two minors in Game Design & Math.
						Around these parts you'll see some fun projects I've worked on; from personal passion projects 
						to school-turned game design projects. I love the challenge of programming, the awe of pouring
						myself into a creative endeavor and witnessing the outcomes, and hopefully my work fervently screams that desire.
						Sometimes I also dabble in the art of website-ing, so enjoy the results :)
