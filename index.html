			Hey there, I'm Josh, a Programmer and Designer from California. 
			I've been feeling the rush of making games since I was 16,
			and am currently an Indie developer. 
			I recently graduated from CSU Channel Islands, 
			studying Computer Science with two minors in Game Design & Math.
			Around these parts you'll see some fun projects I've worked on; from personal passion projects 
			to school-turned game design projects. I love the challenge of programming, the awe of pouring
			myself into a creative endeavor and witnessing the outcomes, and hopefully my work fervently screams that desire.
			Sometimes I also dabble in the art of website-ing, so enjoy the results :)
